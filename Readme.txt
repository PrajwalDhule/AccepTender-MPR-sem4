ABOUT THE PROJECT:

This project was created by me and 2 other students as a mini project in semester 4.
We found this problem statement in the 2022 SIH Problem statements (PS number DR707)

Description of the original ps:
"Background: Government purchases various components through tender which takes a lot of time as the process of allocation of tender takes more than 2 months. Often it is observed after allocation of tender the fulfillment of the required tender takes more than required time. From tender allocation to tender completion it takes more than 6 months to complete all the process as government itself have to compare all the required items. Summary: Government purchases various components through tender which takes a lot of time as the process of allocation of tender takes more than 2 months. Often it is observed after allocation of tender the fulfillment of the required tender takes more than required time. From tender allocation to tender completion it takes more than 6 months to complete all the process as government itself have to compare all the required items. Addressing this issue will help the government in having transparency and parity in rates of items procured by different Govt organizations and the entire process of tender allocation will take very less time then what is taking now. Objective: : There is a requirement of software(Mobile/Web App) for Govt procurements which lists various items with specifications, rates, warranty and compare them and decide the best option., like one available for car insurance etc. This may avoid calling tenders, deciding L1 etc. This may also brought, transparency and parity in rates of items procured by different Govt organisations."
